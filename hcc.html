            <p> Agenda Item: The Communist International
            <br>
            <br>The Third International, officially known as the Communist International or Comintern, was a revolutionary organization founded in March 1919 in Moscow, Soviet Union, under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. It emerged in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917, with the primary goal of uniting and coordinating communist movements worldwide to overthrow capitalist systems and establish a global proletarian revolution.
            <br>
            <br>The Comintern was conceived as a response to the collapse of the Second International, which had failed to prevent the outbreak of World War I due to internal divisions among socialist and labor parties. Unlike its predecessors, the Third International was explicitly aligned with the principles of Marxism-Leninism and sought to create a centralized, disciplined network of communist parties across the globe. It provided ideological guidance, financial support, and strategic direction to revolutionary movements, aiming to spread communism beyond the borders of the Soviet Union.
