            <p>Agenda item: Establishing an International law framework for AI etiquette
            <br>
            <br>
            The agenda, “Establishing an International Law Framework for AI Etiquette,” aims to develop comprehensive global standards for the ethical development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence. As AI continues to revolutionize industries and shape the future, the rapid pace of its advancement has also brought forth significant challenges. Issues such as privacy breaches, algorithmic bias, security vulnerabilities, and unethical or malicious applications of AI technology have become increasingly pressing concerns for governments, corporations, and societies alike. The potential misuse of AI not only risks destabilizing social structures but also threatens to undermine public trust in technological innovation.

Delegates at this forum will work collaboratively to address these urgent challenges by crafting international regulations that promote ethical AI practices, ensuring that AI systems are transparent, fair, and accountable. Discussions will focus on developing mechanisms to enforce these regulations, preventing the exploitation of AI, and safeguarding fundamental human rights. The agenda also seeks to explore strategies to balance the need for innovation with the responsibility to mitigate potential harms, fostering an environment where AI can be harnessed as a force for global good. By establishing a unified legal and ethical framework, this initiative aims to empower nations to work together in building a future where AI technology benefits humanity as a whole while minimizing the risks it poses.
