            The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) is the world’s leading alliance of public service media (PSM). It consists of 113 member organizations and 56 operating countries with an additional 31 associates in Australia, Asia, Africa and the Americas. Members operate nearly 2,000 television, radio and online channels and services, and offer a wealth of content across other platforms. Together they reach an audience of more than one billion people around the world, broadcasting in 153 languages. They operate Eurovision and Euroradio services. The EBU strives to secure a sustainable future for public service media.
The Eurovision Song Contest (ESC), usually referred to as Eurovision, is an international song contest which has been held since 1956. Due to the contestants being delegations of nations, the event is always met with political implications.
In this session of PERTEVMUN'25 this EBU committee will be discussing controversies and injustices in the Eurovision Song Contests (ESC) which have taken place in 2022, 2023 and 2024</p>
