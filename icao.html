            <br>
            <br>One moment, a plane soars through the sky, seconds later, it’s gone; leaving behind only wreckage, unanswered questions, shattered dreams, desperate search for the truth ✈️
            <br>
            <br>
            The sky has been a symbol of human ambition for ages, yet it has also witnessed some of the most tragic disasters in history. Airplane crashes have claimed thousands of lives, leaving nothing but unsolved mysteries, grieving families and an urgent need for stricter safety regulations. From mechanical failures to human errors, terrorism to unanticipated weather, the reasons behind plane crashes are as complex as they are devastating.
            <br>
            As part of the International Civil Aviation Organization, the delegates will examine the most damaging aviation accidents, analyze black box data, uncover the cause behind tragic failures, and propose additional safety measures to prevent further tragedy.            <br>
            <br>
            Prepare yourself to ensure that history does not repeat itself. Otherwise, the skies will always remain a place of uncertainty and danger?
