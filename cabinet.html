            <p>Agenda Item: Cabinet of Kim Song-ju
            <br>
            <br>Kim Song-ju, also known as Kim Il-sung, is the founder of North Korea. He led the country as Supreme Leader from its establishment until his death. Afterward, he was declared “Eternal President”.
            From an early age, Kim formed bold ideologies and rejected the traditions of older-generation Koreans. In 1948, he presented himself as the leader of North Korea with Soviet support. Around the same time, South Korea elected its own leader, which officially divided Korea into two.
            He started the Korean War by invading South Korea in 1950. Backed by the Soviet Union and China, North Korea swiftly advanced south. However, the US and UN intervened and pushed North back. In 1953, a ceasefire was signed, but no peace treaty was ever made.
            Around 1960s he developed the Juche ideology, which promotes absolute loyalty to the leader. He also attempted to assassinate the leader of South Korea. Throughout his rule, he established a dictatorship, suppressing opposition and leading North Korea into economic decline.
            In this committee, our delegates will determine the future of North Korea as Kim Song-ju’s cabinet.
            Who will you trust? Will you be able to reunify the North and the South and restore Korea to its formal imperial glory?</p>
