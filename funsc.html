            <p> Agenda Item: The explosion of the Rawatbhata Nuclear Power Plant
            <br>
            <br>
            After a medium-sized earthquake in India in 2035, the cooling systems of the Rawatbhata Nuclear Power Plant broke down, and the power plant exploded as a result of high heat accumulation. While India was focused on Rawatbhata, an explosion also happened in Kalkuta and in a very important place, the Dakshineswar Kali temple. Pakistani soldiers made a movement, clearly threatening India by directly attacking a regional structure.
In the F-UNSC committee, the economic, political, and environmental movements that will take shape in the international arena after the explosion of this power plant will be discussed, and efforts will be made to ensure the security of the people of India and surrounding countries. Or alliances will be made, and each side will try to take the law into its own hands</p>
